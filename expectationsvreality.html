<div class="carrots"><h1>EXPECTATIONS VS REALITY</h1>


<p class="p1">
“Expectations versus Reality” challenges one’s predisposed notions of reality. This surrealistic and DADA inspired multimedia work incorporates visual and sound pairings that initiates questions about the phenomenon we live in. For example, when cutting a melon one would expect fruit inside but what if that is not the case. In the history of surrealism, pieces are based on the subconscious mind and do not make logical sense just as this piece does not follow linear thinking. This piece reflects surrealism with ambiguity towards time and exaggerated color. Themes of DADA are shown through playfulness, layered ideas, and avant-garde concepts. <br> <br> This piece was later expanded as a multimedia piece with modern dance choreography and the video above projected. The choreography, projection designs, and video are all elements created by me.
<br> <br>
Artist Mika Rottenberg I first drew inspiration from in her video “Spaghetti Blockchain” when I attended her exhibit at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. I was also influenced by the episode “Identity” by Art of the 21st Century Season 1 when Steve Martin sets the scene. Finally, the music videos ‘Locket’ and ‘M.R.’ for the band “Crumb” inspired me as well as ASMR videos.

<p class="p2">Reviewing my creative process for the initial video I created a storyboard with camera angles and action/shot for each frame. I was continually retaking shots and editing clips throughout. Because of the large number of props I had to buy numerous dew melons and carrots before getting the correct shot. Just as in a dream, time is often incoherent just as the conclusion of the video speeds up with new combinations of the props previously introduced in the video. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>  </p>
