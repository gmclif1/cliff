<span>BALLET BODY PERFORMANCE ART </span> <br> <br> ‘The Ballet Body’ is a performance art piece that starts the conversation around body image in the dance world. I want to change the concept of how one should look by redirecting the focus to athleticism and health. There is no one ‘dancer body’. The imagery of a long neck, small waist, and long legs that Ballenchine instilled in dance leads to unhealthy and unrealistic expectations that most dancers can not obtain. Yes, some dancers can maintain this body and be healthy but that should not be the standard. This topic brings attention to a subject that is still rarely talked about in the ballet/dance community. I have personal experiences relating to this subject having danced my whole life and being immersed in studio dance and college dance.

Awarded 2nd Place 3D and selected to display a video of my performance piece 'Ballet Body' in the 2023
Cleve Carney Art Gallery 2023 Exhibition Issued by Juror Erin Washington.

This piece is broken down into three sections with the first section tying the pointe shoes, a performance, and concluding with the pointe shoes being untied. Audio of prominent dancers play including Misty Copeland, Kathryn Morgan, and Luna Montana. Body image is discussed while tying and untying the pointe shoes symbolizing the thoughts that go through a dancer’s mind before and after a show.

One piece that inspired me was ‘How we experience time and memory through art: Sarah Sze Interview’ through the specific objects I chose to include in the performance art. In regards to the space, a curtain is draped with a single industrial light casted over my body. I wanted this to allude to the backstage of a theatre where a dancer would quickly change before performing on stage. The way the curtain is draped is similar to the classical era just as ballet’s origin is during the classical era. Most of my body sits in shadow with a rather somber mood. In an interview, Sarah Sze talks about objects occupying spaces in the form of memory. I wanted to create a space that held memories of past performances. Another inspiration is ‘The Case for Performance Art (The Art Assignment)’ The piece is not about the dancing but the emotional cost that comes with being a dancer.
